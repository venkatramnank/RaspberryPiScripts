## Description
- LDR_buzzer.py : Python script to read analog input and compare the measured value with reference value. If measured value is greater than Reference Value then turn ON a buzzer.
- LED_Blinker.py : Python script to blink an LED continously
- LED_binary_counter.py : Python script for implementing binary counter using LED
- LED_switch.py : Python script for LED ON/OFF based on switch
- Oled_pic.py : Python script to display image on OLED display
- message_oled.py : Python script to display message on OLED display
- oled_switch_led.py : OLED displays on or off based on switch and LED
- servo.py : Python script for basic servo movements
- servo_sensor.py : Python script for operating servo based on switch/sensor status
